## Subroutine-threaded Forth for x86-64
#### (WIP; provisionary name)

Inspired by FreeForth, eForth, and the flat assembler, this is an attempt to balance speed, simplicity, and compactness.

Future goals:
* Included assembler for x86-64
* Self-hosting through flat binaries
* Usable as a compiler backend

Some day, I hope to metacompile this to bare metal and implement a hobby operating system.

To anyone reading this, including myself:
* I am not rushing into this. I have plenty of design notes and formal education in OS development.
* Nonetheless, I am aware that this undertaking is a gargantuan challenge.
  * Especially using an alternative language, and even moreso with fully custom tooling.
* Don't get your hopes up. This will take time, of which I may not have enough.
